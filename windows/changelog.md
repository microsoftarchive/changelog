## 3.6.11.0 (Windows 10)
- We've fixed the keyboard not popping up when you're in Tablet Mode on Surface and want to add a to-do.
- We've changed the "Pending" label next to an invite in a shared list to orange instead of blue. It's the little things. 
- If you left Wunderlist running over midnight you may have felt like you were in a time-warp with your Due Dates and Reminders not updating. We've fixed that and can confirm that you will now be firmly in the present.
- The size of our drop down menus changed when opening the Smart List settings for Week & Today. We've made everything more uniform now.
- We fixed a little bug that was cutting off the text on attached files.
- Getting crashes when ticking off a to-do or when selecting multiple to-dos while searching? This update shall crash your app no more. 
- Talking of crashes, we've also fixed the one where Wunderlist crashed if you were attaching a file that was already open.
- Sometimes we weren't giving your priority tasks enough respect. If your starred to-dos weren't moving to the top of the list, we're sorry, they will now. 
- We like you to be able to see your to-dos as you add them so we've fixed the issue that made your new to-dos invisible. 
- We took out the option to change Completed to-dos to be Due Today in the context menu, because it just didn't make sense. 
- Speaking of which, autocorrecting your email addresses really didn't make sense either so you'll be happy to know we've removed that.
- If you like to watch the number of completed items go up and down as you tick and untick your to-dos you will have been aghast at the bug that didn't change the number count when you unticked a to-do. Fear not, we've fixed it now. 
- When you sort your to-dos, e.g. alphabetically, you can now click Sort a second time in order to reverse the order. 
- Various other small bug fixes.

## 3.6.9.0 (Windows 10)

- Various other bug fixes.
